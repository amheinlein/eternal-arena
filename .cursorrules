# Eternal Arena Development Workflow Rules

## Development Day Workflow

The project uses a day-by-day development workflow where each day's work is archived in `archives/dayX/` folders.

### Key Commands

When the user uses these natural language commands, execute the corresponding workflow:

#### "What was my last day?" / "What is my last development day?"
- Check the `archives/` directory for the highest numbered `dayX` folder
- Report the last day number and optionally read the summary from `archives/dayX/dayX.md`

#### "I am starting development day X" / "Starting day X" / "Start day X"
1. Read `archives/day(X-1)/docs/specs/whats-next.md` if it exists
2. Read `archives/day(X-1)/day(X-1).md` if it exists
3. Present a concise summary:
   - Where we left off (from previous day summary)
   - Next steps (from whats-next.md)
   - Current state of the project

#### "I am finished with development day X" / "Finished with day X" / "End day X"
Execute the following workflow:

1. **Create archive folder**: Create `archives/dayX/` directory (if it doesn't exist)

2. **Create day summary**: 
   - Generate a one paragraph summary for what was acoomplished this day
   - Prompt the user for a summary of what was accomplished
   - Create `archives/dayX/dayX.md` with the generated summary followed by the user's summary

   - Format: Use "# Day X Summary - [Brief Title]" as header, then the generated summary paragraph
     - Use # Day My Take - [Brief Title] as the second header followed by the user's summary

3. **Copy project files**:
   - Copy all files and directories from project root to `archives/dayX/`
   - **Exclude**: `archives/` folder and its contents
   - **Include**: All other files including `docs/`, `README.md`, source files, config files, etc.
   - Maintain the directory structure

4. **Export transcripts**:
   - Note: Transcripts should be manually exported from Cursor's chat history for the day
   - Create `archives/dayX/transcripts/` directory
   - Inform the user that they need to export transcripts manually and place them in this folder
   - The transcripts should be exported from all chats/sessions from that development day

5. **Generate whats-next.md**:
   - Read all `.md` files in `docs/specs/` directory
   - Review the content to understand current state and what's been designed
   - Create `archives/dayX/docs/specs/whats-next.md` with:
     - A summary of what has been designed/documented so far
     - Identification of next logical steps in development
     - Recommendations for what to tackle next
     - Any gaps or incomplete areas that need attention

6. **Commit and push repository**:
   - Stage all changes (including the new archive folder and files)
   - Commit with a message like "Archive day X: [brief summary]"
   - Push to the remote repository
   - Inform the user if there are any uncommitted changes that should be reviewed first

### File Structure Expectations

- Project root: Active development files
- `archives/dayX/`: Snapshot of project at end of day X
- `archives/dayX/dayX.md`: Summary of day X accomplishments
- `archives/dayX/docs/specs/whats-next.md`: Next steps planned for day X+1
- `archives/dayX/transcripts/`: Chat transcripts from day X

### Notes

- Always preserve the `archives/` folder - never copy it or its contents during archive operations
- When copying files, maintain relative paths and directory structure
- The `whats-next.md` file should be forward-looking and actionable
- Day numbers should be sequential integers starting from 1
- When starting a new day, the user may provide the day number, or you can infer it from the last archived day + 1
