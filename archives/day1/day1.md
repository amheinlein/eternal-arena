# Day 1 Summary - Game Design & Architecture

Today we established the foundational design and architecture for Eternal Arena, an action-based arena RPG inspired by ArenaScape and idle/incremental games like Inflation RPG. We created a lean, scalable documentation structure in `docs/specs/` starting with an overview document that serves as an entry point with one-sentence summaries linking to detailed component documents (core-loop, skills, combat, items, quests, magic, progression, and architecture). Our primary focus was designing the technical architecture for a React Native/TypeScript monorepo targeting Web, iOS, and Android platforms. The architecture follows a layered, library-style approach (Controller → Service → Repository) using ContextObject, Strategy, and Factory patterns to handle the game's various action types (battle, shop, quests, magic, etc.). We made key architectural decisions including selecting Zustand for state management (providing minimal boilerplate with excellent TypeScript support), implementing a hybrid caching strategy (Zustand store caching for config data plus repository-level file caching), and establishing a comprehensive error handling system with structured error classes, error boundaries, and global error handlers. The complete architecture is documented in `docs/specs/architecture.md` with detailed TypeScript interfaces and code examples, setting a solid foundation for implementation while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
