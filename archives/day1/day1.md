# Day 1 Summary - Game Design & Architecture

Today we established the foundational design and architecture for Eternal Arena, an action-based arena RPG inspired by ArenaScape and idle/incremental games like Inflation RPG. We created a lean, scalable documentation structure in `docs/specs/` starting with an overview document that serves as an entry point with one-sentence summaries linking to detailed component documents (core-loop, skills, combat, items, quests, magic, progression, and architecture). Our primary focus was designing the technical architecture for a React Native/TypeScript monorepo targeting Web, iOS, and Android platforms. The architecture follows a layered, library-style approach (Controller → Service → Repository) using ContextObject, Strategy, and Factory patterns to handle the game's various action types (battle, shop, quests, magic, etc.). We made key architectural decisions including selecting Zustand for state management (providing minimal boilerplate with excellent TypeScript support), implementing a hybrid caching strategy (Zustand store caching for config data plus repository-level file caching), and establishing a comprehensive error handling system with structured error classes, error boundaries, and global error handlers. The complete architecture is documented in `docs/specs/architecture.md` with detailed TypeScript interfaces and code examples, setting a solid foundation for implementation while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.


# Day 1 My take - Setting the stage

Today we started with nothing and ended with a solid foundation for this project. We decided on a strategy for building this application along with day by day progress. We setup cursor rules to handle this piece by saying "I am done with this development day". It is setup so that I can start each development day with "Hey cursor, lets start the next day!" and cursor will help me pickup where we left off including a brief summary of the previous day and summarizing the "what's next" document. We also set the foundation for our documentation and how we plan to build out this application. We dug into some architectural direction, made some hard decisions like a monorepo react native/typescript application so we can deploy to app stores and web. We also decided to use Zustand for state management. I initially thought of Redux as that is what i am more familiar with, but this seemed like a good time to try a new framework. 

# Day 1 My Take - whats next
AI is helping to generate some form of a roadmap in the whats-next.md. I think a good mix of my gut and AI's thoughts will be helpful, so going to add my own thinking what i see as the best next steps. I will write this up before i close the development day so cursor can potentially use this to help with the roadmap.
Design documents are going to be the lifeline for this game. They will be the source of truth for every aspect of this game. They will be living documents for how things work, and will be updated as we learn things along the way. These documents need to be written before any code. That said, if we have enough of a feature documented properly, I want to build it and test it as soon as possible. I hope and expect that if we build and test early, we can update our design documents with any changes and be able to make necessary changes. I also believe that with well kept documentation, the power of AI will be able to make huge architectural pivots and a much lower cost than traditional software development. Also the better that the features are documented, I believe the AI will be able to understand much easier and provide even better solutions - and AI can update documentation automatically, so why not!
I want to jump into screens followed by the first screen we will implement - likely the main menu. I want to design this as well as possible and see if we have enough to build it. i think we will need to flesh out a few more items but should be able to get the first screen done.
