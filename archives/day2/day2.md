# Day 2 Summary - Main Menu Implementation & Placeholder System

Today we implemented a complete Main Menu system and established a comprehensive placeholder/feedback policy for Eternal Arena. We created the foundational infrastructure including a toast notification system using Zustand stores with animated Toast components, game state initialization services with default player and run state creation, and reusable UI components (ActionCounter, ActionButton, QuickAccessButton, RunStatusDisplay, PersistentStatsPreview) following React Native best practices. The Main Menu screen was fully implemented with all navigation buttons, action tracking, run status displays, and proper state management, while the Run Start screen handles new game initialization with persistent bonus display. We created placeholder screens for all future features (Battle List, Boss Battle List, Shop, Quest, Magic, Inventory, Stats, Settings, Run End) following a consistent "Coming Soon" pattern with back navigation. Navigation was fully configured using expo-router with all routes properly set up. We also established a placeholder/feedback policy documented in `.cursorrules` and `architecture.md` requiring all unimplemented features to provide user feedback (toasts for buttons, placeholder screens for navigation), and created `docs/placeholder-backlog.md` to track all placeholder items with status, priority, and notes. All store enhancements were completed including run management methods (`initializeNewRun`, `startNewRun`, `endRun`) in the gameStore and toast methods in the uiStore, resulting in a fully functional Main Menu hub with complete navigation structure and user feedback systems ready for future feature implementation.

# Day 2 My Take - Infrastructure and Feedback Loop

Today was all about the infrastructure and getting the feedback loop started. We can now run and see the game in action. We made some decisions like ensuring placeholders and user notification about unimplemented features were present. We are also writing them to a backlog - handled by .cursorrules. 

For tomorrow i think the next steps will be to go to the stats and inventory screens. I would like to see a default weapon which can equip/unequip and have an initial design on how stats and inventory contributes to a combat snapshot. Once these are in place i think we can design the first enemy and see a battle!
